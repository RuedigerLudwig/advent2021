# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for the great puzzles and the great time I had solving them.

For the year 2021 I decided to go with Python again. This time its version 3.10 and no additional modules.

If you look at the code and see ways I could improve it, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always grateful for everything that makes me a better programmer.
